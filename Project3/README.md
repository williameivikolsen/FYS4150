## Project 3 - FYS4150

### A brief description of the different files in this folder

The files in this folder solves the [given assignment](http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics/doc/Projects/2020/Project3/pdf/Project3.pdf).

`execute.py` is the main program intended to be ran by the user. It asks the user

* what physical system to be solved
  1. Sun and Earth
  2. Sun, Earth and Jupiter
  3. All planets in the solar system (+ Pluto!)
  4. Sun and Mercury
* how long to simulate for (in years)
* the number of integration points
* in case of the Sun+Earth system: if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{i \pi} = -1">

if it wants to re-compile the program, what physical system to be solved, what kind of parameters to be used, and if the program is to be run in testing mode.
